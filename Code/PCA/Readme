The Python file and all 9 plots have been uploaded. I've put comments on the code as well.
The program takes command line input as the file name to analyze(Eg: Python PCA.py "pca_a.txt").

I strongly urge you guys to review this as much as possible and provide your feedback.
I've verified PCA and SVD data sets(as this is verifiable against the library). However, TNSE is a convex function and gives different values in each run and hence is unverifiable.
